# WaveGenerator
Attempt to create a program in R to estimate the parameters of a sin wave

This program uses the nls functionality on some dummy data to try and see if a sin wave can be fitted. 
The data were designed to have a sin wave distribution, but the fitting using nls is poor and highly sensitive to the starting parameters.
